# Covid19-Detection
Covid19 detection done using mobilenet_v2_130_224 pretrained classified model
Dataset is small as I was not able to get good amount of data source for covid patients. Dataset of normal patient is taken from pneumonia dataset set from kaggle
Papers that gives little confidence that machine learning can be useful in identifying new viruses such as COVID19.

A team of scientist is collected the datasets for Covid patients, and dataset can be obtained from below github link
https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

Data for the normal chest xray is taken from kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Dataset is very small with 142 positive covid sample and 142 clean chest xray samples.

Dataset is then divided into training and test samples.
